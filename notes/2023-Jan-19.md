## Agda termination issues

Despite my efforts, `ContextDiagrams.agda` still does not termination check.

My best attempt at explaining this at the moment is that Agda doesn't know what the induction scheme on the big mutually recursive definition is.
The outermost induction is on n. Within this, we define M by induction on h and t, while π⋆ᴹ is ultimately defined by induction on the predicate `[ i , h' , t' ]≤ₛ[ h , t ]`.

*Do I also do induction on h, t for `π⋆ᴹ`?* I'm not sure if it also affects matters that it's indexed on two copies of (h,t)---which instance of h, t should I induct on?

**Note:** Debug termination checker using `{-# OPTIONS -vterm:50 #-}`.

**Some observations:**
+ The termination error does not appear before we give the final argument `OO[≤ₛ] iS'` to `π⋆ᴹ` in the definition clause for `M 1+ O [ i , O , 1+ t ] iS ltS`.

**Possible fixes/workarounds:**
+ `π⋆ᴹ` does not need to be defined using the induction principle on `[ i , h' , t' ]≤ₛ[ h , t ]`. (Though keep in mind that we *did* want to define `Π⋆` using this, in order to try to avoid transport hell.)
+ Write some kind of induction principle for the bundled definition (whether parts of it, or the whole thing)?
