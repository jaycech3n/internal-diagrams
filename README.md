# Diagrams in internal models of homotopy type theory

+ Internal categories with families, Reedy fibrant diagrams, and related things in univalent foundations (MLTT with univalence).
+ Depends on the Agda 2.6.2.2-compatible fork of the HoTT-Agda library <https://github.com/awswan/HoTT-Agda/tree/agda-2.6.1-compatible>.
