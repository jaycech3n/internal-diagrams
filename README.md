# Diagrams in internal models of homotopy type theory

+ Internal categories with families, Reedy fibrant diagrams, and related things in univalent foundations (MLTT with univalence).
+ Uses Agda 2.6.1.3 and depends on <https://github.com/awswan/HoTT-Agda/tree/agda-2.6.1-compatible>.
+ Very conservativeâ€”rewriting is completely disallowed, and we try to avoid inductive types, HITs, and coinduction.
